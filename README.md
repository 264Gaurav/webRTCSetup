# WebRTC SDP Exchange

This project demonstrates a simple WebRTC setup where two users can exchange SDP offers and answers manually without a signaling server.

## Project Structure


## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in two separate browser tabs or windows.
2. Follow the instructions on the page:
   - **User 1**: Click "Create Offer" to generate an SDP offer.
   - Copy the generated SDP offer and paste it into the corresponding field in **User 2**'s tab.
   - **User 2**: Click "Create Answer" after pasting the offer, then copy the generated SDP answer and paste it back into **User 1**'s tab.
3. Once the SDP exchange is complete, the video streams should connect.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer video streaming using WebRTC.
- Manual SDP exchange for learning purposes.
